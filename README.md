Intent of Program: 
The following program will run a Memory Game on an FPGA Device. The target device in our 
design is a Terasic's FPGA Cyclone V. This game is intended to be played by one player. 
Using toggle switches and buttons on the device, the user is responsible of memorizing 
psuedorandomly generated sequences flashed on the seven segment display on the device and 
then inputting them back into the device. 

A full game explanation can be seen in the "doc" folder titled "userManual.docx".

A full design documentation can be seen in the "doc" folder titled "designDoc.docx".

A full demonstration can be found in the "demo" folder.

All relevant code can be seen in the "src" folder. A top-level hierarchy design is utilized 
in this project. The top-level module is labled "finalTopLevel.v".
